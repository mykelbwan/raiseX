GoFundMe â€” a private, decentralized crowdfunding smart contract built on TEN Protocol, leveraging its privacy-by-default execution.
This contract allows anyone to create crowdfunding campaigns, accept anonymous contributions, and withdraw raised funds after the campaign ends.

It demonstrates how decentralized coordination and programmable privacy can coexist, making it a public good that showcases privacy-preserving transparency in practice.
